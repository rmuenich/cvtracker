## Academic COI Tracker

Like many researchers, I try to focus my time on developing new ideas and creating new work, not on paperwork. Yet we are asked to constantly keep track of potential COI's in very long forms with different requirements for formatting across different agencies. Therefor, I developed the code here to read in a database of all of your COIs (you will have to make, but you can import things from ORCID if you want to automate that) and then filter COIs based on date, remove duplicates while keeping most recent COI, then spit out CSV files that can be copied into the templates. For now I have only done this for NSF and USDA, but if you'd like to collaborate on other agencies please let me know!
